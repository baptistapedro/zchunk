# Mayhemfile: configuration file for testing your target with Mayhem
# Format: YAML 1.1

# Project name that the target belongs to
project: baptistapedro/zchunk-unzck-fuzz

# Target name (should be unique within the project)
target: zchunk-unzck-fuzz-latest

# Base image to run the binary in.
image: index.docker.io/pedbap/zchunk-unzck-fuzz@sha256:1acf7c8971846f67a6ce6b8bc95a9a672e74fb34bee0c1edbc3a28789cfd4793

# Turns on extra test case processing (completing a run will take longer)
advanced_triage: false

# List of commands used to test the target
cmds:

  # Command used to start the target, "@@" is the input file
  # (when "@@" is omitted Mayhem defaults to stdin inputs)
  - cmd: /zchunk/build/src/unzck input.zck
    filepath: input.zck
    ## Uncomment to change default dir (/) from which the target is invoked
    #cwd: /

    ## Uncomment the block below to define environment variables
    #env:
    #  MY_ENV_VAR: MY_ENV_VALUE

    ## If this is a network target, uncomment the block below and remove
    ## the @@ input file reference in the cmd (you can either test network or
    ## file inputs, not both).
    #network:
    ## Use "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost" below if you want to test only
    ## for IPv4. For IPv6, use "[::1]". By leaving as "localhost", Mayhem will
    ## attempt to autodetect the one used by the target.
    #  url: tcp://localhost:8080  # protocol, host and port to analyze
    #  client: False           # target is a client-side program
    #  timeout: 2.0               # max seconds for sending data

    ## Max test case length (in bytes) to be taken into account. Test cases over
    ## that length will be truncated. Be very careful about increasing this
    ## limit as it can severely affect your fuzzer performance.
    # max_length: 8192
